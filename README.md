# DeepSequencePPI
Protein-Protein Interaction prediction using a deep RNN-based neural network architecture.

You can access our code as a Jupyter Notebook in this repository.

The AA sequence data used was obtained from Uniprot (the full reviewed database, or only the ones in the interaction datasets, you decide!).

All the interaction datasets were obtained from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28514151 . In their abstract there is a link to the data we used, as well as their own code (used to replicate their experiments and compare our methods).

Feel free to ask any questions! (I will include the conference paper as well in the repository).
